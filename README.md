# Olist Enterprise – Customer Analytics & Retention Studio

##  Overview
This project is an **end-to-end customer analytics and retention platform** built on the Olist e-commerce dataset.  
It provides a **reusable pipeline** that ingests raw transactional data, cleans & normalizes it, generates **RFM segments**, defines a **90-day churn label**, trains a baseline churn model, and surfaces insights through interactive BI dashboards.

The project is designed with **two tracks**:
- **Track A** → Pandas + Scikit-learn (lightweight local analysis)
- **Track B** → PostgreSQL + Docker + BI tools (enterprise-style workflow)

---

##  Features
- **Data Cleaning & Normalization** → Pandas preprocessing scripts with validation checks.  
- **RFM Segmentation** → Automatic computation of Recency, Frequency, Monetary scores.  
- **Churn Prediction** → 90-day churn label with baseline logistic regression model.  
- **SQL Marts** → PostgreSQL materialized tables for RFM & churn features.  
- **BI Dashboards** → Power BI & Tableau visualizations for retention insights.  
- **Deployment Ready** → Gradio app for local demos, Hugging Face Spaces for free hosting.
